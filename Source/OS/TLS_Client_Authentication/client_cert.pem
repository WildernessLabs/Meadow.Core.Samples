Replace this file with your client certificate in .pem format (REQUIRED):

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

IMPORTANT:
If you have a certificate in .PFX format, you can extract the private key 
and the client certificate from it using the OpenSSL library. 
You just need to run the following commands to generate the `private_key.pem` 
and  `client_cert.pem` files:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in yourfile.pfx -nocerts -out private_key.pem
openssl pkcs12 -in yourfile.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out client_cert.pem
```
