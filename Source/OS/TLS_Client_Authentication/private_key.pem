Replace this file with your private key in .pem format (REQUIRED):

-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

IMPORTANT:
1 - If you have an encrypted private key, add its passphrase to the 
private_key_pass.txt file. 

2 - You may see this error `Failed to parse private key` if you attempt 
to use encrypted private keys, since some encryption algorithms are not 
supported by the Meadow TLS provider (mbedTLS). In that case, try to encrypt 
your private key using another algorithm, such as the RSA algorithm with DES3 
(Triple DES) encryption and the traditional PKCS#1 formatting, which can be done 
by using the OpenSSL library:

```bash
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -out private_key_output.pem -des3 -traditional
```

Then, you should get a private key with a header like this:
```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
DEK-Info: DES-EDE3-CBC,637E819E82DF740E
```
```
